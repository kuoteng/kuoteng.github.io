寫在前面，這學期修習了一門學術英語寫作，也嘗試把自己的一些課程筆記放上來 blog 看看

# Academic Writing Features

## Audience
- Target audience: 觀眾是誰？
    - 請看 author’s word
    - 讀該期刊最新兩期的 paper，掌握他們的觀眾是誰
## Purpose
- writing angle：經由觀眾的 background knowledge 來判斷
    - audience < writer：教科書
    - audience > writer：類似與指導教授的互動，你不必介紹太多前備知識
- writers’ tone
    - 是否 Too assertive? Too void? Confident but is aware of the limitations?
    - 美式論文總會寫道：「The find …」
        1. 現在式
        2. 理直氣壯
    - 英式、歐式
## Organization
- 論文的重點：透過結構化格式將「資訊」傳遞給讀者，所以即使是小片段也會有 regular和predictable 的結構
- 這對應到提案（proposal）的四大要素：SPSE (Hoey, 1983)
    - 不過因為提案總是在結果產出前，帶有「預期效果」，所以不太一樣
- 也有其他的寫作模式：Comparison & Contrast（行動研究）、Cause & Effect、Classification

**SPSE**

- description of a **S**ituation: historical background into/ explanation of the phenomenon
- identification of a **P**roblem: research questions/ research purpose/ previous literatures
- description of a **S**olution: Literature review/ Methodology
- **E**valuation of the solution: Results & Discussion

## Style
- 學術寫作需要保持「一致性」和「適切」的用詞，例如：such as 不正式（但十年前可用），應該改用 like
- 何謂學術論文：
    - 有邏輯且精準的語言（defining academic）
    - 因果比較（standardizing variations in different fields/communities）
    - 跟隨最新成果更新的用詞（keeping track of updated principles/rules）

**何謂學術的正式語？**

- 舉例：
```
    (錯誤) => (正確)
    put up with => tolerate
    looking into => investigating
    figure out => determine
    come up with => developd
    make up => constitute
    get rid of => eliminate
    gone up => reached
    keep up => maintain
    gone down => decrease
    thinking about => considering
    really important for => an intergral part of
    just about => nearly
    a lot of => considerable
    nice （並不是非常正式的字） => robust
    getting bigger and bigger => increasing
    not => no

```
- 不是片語或少介系詞、多為一個單字
```
    (錯誤) => (正確)
    come up with => offer/ find
    test => examine
    ask for => inform
    tell => provide
    keep up => maintain
    get rid of => eliminate

    facts => evidence
    job => profession
    goal => objective
    tool => means
    thinking => opinion
    because of => as a result of/ due to
    also => furthermore/ moreover

    lots of=> many

    maybe => perhaps/ possibly
    but => however/ nevertheless
```
**何謂正式的文法？**

- Avoid contractions 避免縮寫
    - can’t → can not/cannot
    - don’t → do not
    - Allergic reactions to local dental anesthesia **seldenly** happen.
- Use formal negative forms 使用正式的否定名詞，而不是使用 not（避免使用 not）：no、little、few
    - the analysis yielded **no** new results
    - the government allocated **little** funding to the program
    - this problem has **few** viable solutions
- Limit the use of "and so forth" and "etc." 避免模糊範圍的舉例，避免`etc.`、`and so forth`
    - 明確使用 other … 來舉出範圍
    - 或是使用 for example 來舉例
- Less impersonal style 常用第三人稱（但工科常用主動式如**we**，代表一種背書，是可以的）
    - the results can be seen in Table 1, we can see the results in Table 1
- Few direction questions 不要用主動疑問句，請使用間接疑問句
    - the application of the results needs to be carefully considered 而非直接說我們需要
    - 除非是自己的研究主題，因為本來就是想搞清楚這個「研究問題」
- More Passive Voice
- be concise：避免頭重腳輕的虛主詞結構
- Adverbs within the verb 請多將副詞多置於句中，放於動詞前後（不要使用 because of）
    - 學術文章不像是新聞

    Gold
    ---
    (Throughout history, gold has always been one of the most used materials.) Gold, a precious metal, is prized for two important characteristics. First of all, gold has a lustrous beauty that is resistant to corrosion. Therefore, it is suitable for jewelry, coins, and ornamental purposes. Gold never needs to be polished and will remain beautiful forever. For example, a Macedonian coin remains as untarnished today as the day it was made 25 centuries ago. Another important characteristic of gold is its usefulness to industry and science. For many years, it has been used in hundreds of industrial applications, such as photography and dentistry. The most recent use of gold is in astronauts’ suits. Astronauts wear gold-plated heat shields for protection when they go outside spaceships in space. In conclusion, gold is treasured not only for its beauty but also for its utility. (For these reasons, we can foresee its longlasting popularity in different industries.)
